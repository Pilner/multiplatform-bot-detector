",50
1050006840,joel_archie ,,,,,"@ladyhaja Thing is, he was fantastic when Klopp dropped him into the starting XI out of the blue vs Everton at Anfield last December. There's still a really good player in there, just not sure if/when we'll actually get to see it again.
",237
1050006840,joel_archie ,,,,,"@jp_lfc @ladyhaja Yep, exactly that. Looked great on the eye but clearly wasn't doing something Klopp wanted from him in that role.
",132
1050006840,joel_archie ,,,,,"@Kenneth_W89 It's possible, but from what I've seen so far he looks best suited slightly deeper where he's more actively involved in the buildup play.
",151
1050006840,joel_archie ,,,,,"@the_2nd_born Right-hand side, probably.
",41
1050006840,joel_archie ,,,,,"@ladyhaja Such a mystery. Was so fun to watch in the first half of 18/19 as the fourth man in 4-2-3-1, but get the sense Klopp was still never fully convinced by what he offered off the ball. Last season he was just barely available through perpetual fitness issues. Would love a revival!
",289
1050006840,joel_archie ,,,,,"@PRITCHNEWS Ideally I think Liverpool need to improve on Origi. Minamino can be a real asset but like you say, probably requires a change of system. Brewster is the big unknown (for now). I'd still like to see someone like Ismaila Sarr, or another player of that ilk.
",268
1050006840,joel_archie ,,,,,"@the_2nd_born I can definitely see that. Either as the no.10 or cutting in off the left as he did vs Arsenal.
",110
1050006840,joel_archie ,,,,,"@AdamPMurrell I think they're probably just being (understandably) extra cautious. Without knowing the ins and outs of the finances, I'd guess they're waiting for more clarity about outgoings before they commit to more signings.
",229
1050006840,joel_archie ,,,,,"@langside1985 He would certainly help, but doesn't solve the issue of how Liverpool compensate for the front three when one (or more) of them is injured/fatigued/out of form.
",175
1050006840,joel_archie ,,,,,"@thorkelyimo I agree, he would've been ideal.
",46
1050006840,joel_archie ,,,,,"Minamino feels like someone who'll be great supplementing the attack in more of a 4-2-3-1/4-2-2-2, as opposed to directly replacing any of them. Shaqiri not in the picture. Brewster promising, but could go on loan. Which then leaves Origi as the default alternative...again.
",275
1050006840,joel_archie ,,,,,"@thorkelyimo He's not the only player who exists who could come in and improve what Liverpool currently have.
",110
1050006840,joel_archie ,,,,,"It's not just the risk of injuries to Man√©/Salah/Firmino. It's having the option to change things when they could do with a rest, or are just in a bad run of form. Banking on them all to be in peak condition throughout a hyper-condensed fixture schedule is a huge gamble.
",272
1050006840,joel_archie ,,,,,"@SeannBewey Another muscular niggle it seems. Trained the first few days in Austria but hasn't been in the squad for any of the pre-season games so far. I'd hoped he'd return and have a role to play, but can't rely on his availability.
",236
1050006840,joel_archie ,,,,,"@grdewe Not about warming the bench. There are loads of games packed tightly together. Had Werner signed, he'd have played loads. Liverpool need options.
",154
1050006840,joel_archie ,,,,,"Thiago would obviously be a brilliant signing for Liverpool, should it eventually happen. I can't help but feel the ongoing focus on this saga is somewhat clouding over the more urgent issue of adding quality cover/competition for the front three.

",311

",133
1050006840,joel_archie ,,,,,"@DavidSegar_ @IanRSalmon Yeah, I think that's it. Free transfers aren't actually free due to huge signing-on fees, and time is of the essence given his age. Probably only has 3-4 seasons (maximum) left at world class level, so ideally you don't want to miss one of them by waiting.
",282
1050006840,joel_archie ,,,,,"@IanRSalmon Think there's definitely a case to pay a fee to get him now, if they could reach a compromise below the initial asking price. A) he helps you win the title in 2020/21 and B) stops other teams swooping in opportunistically.
